DOCSTART_D-block_contraction
d-block
contraction
-LRB-
sometimes
called
scandide
contraction
-RRB-
is
a
term
used
in
chemistry
to
describe
the
effect
of
having
full
d
orbitals
on
the
MMSTART_181554
period
MMEND
4
elements
.

elements

.
Their
electronic
configurations
include
completely
filled
d

.
d-block
contraction
is
best
illustrated
by
comparing
some
properties
of
the
MMSTART_144929
group
13
elements
MMEND
to
highlight
the
effect
on
gallium
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gallium
can
be
seen
to
be
anomalous
.
The
most
obvious
effect
is
that
the
sum
of
the
first
three
s
of
gallium
is
higher
than
that
of
aluminium
,
whereas
the
trend
in
the
group
would
be
for
it
to
be
lower
.

element
MMEND
s
and
have
three
valence
electrons
above
a

noble
gas
MMEND
electron
core
.
In
contrast
to
the
MMSTART_144929
group
13
elements
MMEND
this
sequence
shows
a
smooth
reduction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
effects
of
the
d-block
contraction
are
that
the
Ga3
+
ion
is
smaller
than
expected
,
being
closer
in
size
to
Al3
+
.
Care
must
be
taken
in
interpreting
the
ionization
potentials
for
indium
and
thallium
,
other
effects
e.g.
the
MMSTART_827232
inert
pair
effect
MMEND
become
increasingly
important
for
the
heavier
members
of
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cause
of
the
d-block
contraction
is
the
poor
shielding
of
the
nuclear
charge
by
the
electrons
in
the
d
orbitals
.
The
outer
valence
electrons
are
more
strongly
attracted
by
the
nucleus
causing
the
observed
increase
in
ionization
potentials
.
The
d-block
contraction
can
be
compared
to
the

lanthanide
contraction

Iowa
's
10th
congressional
district
existed
from
1883
to
1933
,
when
MMSTART_26810748
Iowa
MMEND
sent
eleven
congressmen
to
the
MMSTART_19468510
United
States
House
of
Representatives
MMEND
.
The
district
,
known
as
``
The
Big
Tenth
,
''
covered
large
areas
of
north-central
Iowa
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
1883
to
1886
,
the
district
included
the
north-central
Iowa
counties
of

Reapportionment
in
1886
reflected
the
increasing
population
balance
between
eastern
and
western
Iowa
,
resulting
in
a
westward
shift
of
the
district
's
boundaries
.
From
1886
until
1933
,
the
district
was
made
up
of
Boone
,
MMSTART_96027
Calhoun

,

and

counties
.
After
1886
,
the
boundaries
of
the
district
never
changed
;
the
MMSTART_1213502
Iowa
General
Assembly
MMEND
refused
to
reapportion
its
districts
until
the
loss
of
two
seats
following
the
1930
census
left
the
State
with
no
other
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
district
was
predominantly
rural
,
especially
in
its
1886
reconfiguration
.
During
that
period
,
it
included
only
one
of
Iowa
's
twenty
largest
cities
--
MMSTART_114334
Fort
Dodge
MMEND
--
and
included
counties
that
had
been
relatively
slow
to
settle
.
However
,
by
1895
the
large
area
of
the
10th
District
,
coupled
with
increased
migration
to
its
small
towns
,
caused
it
to
have
the
largest
population
of
any
of
Iowa
's
congressional
districts
.
By
1890
,
the
continued
disproportionate
increase
in
the
population
of
the
10th
and
MMSTART_22384888
11th
MMEND
Districts
caused
some
to
predict
that
the
General
Assembly
would
need
to
reduce
the
area
of
each
district
,
but
no
such
change
occurred
.
By
1921
,
the
10th
District
had
over
100,000
more
residents
than
the
1st
District
,
and
nearly
60,000
more
than
the
population
of
an
ideally-sized
Iowa
congressional
district
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
congressman
elected
from
this
district
was
a
member
of
the
MMSTART_32070
Republican
Party
MMEND
.
As
a
general
matter
,
the
most
influential
event
during
each
election
year
was
not
the
November
general
election
,
but
the
Republican
Party
's
district
nominating
convention
-LRB-
or
later
,
the
Republican
primary
-RRB-
.
Two
10th
district
congressmen
-LRB-
MMSTART_350053
Jonathan
P.
Dolliver
MMEND
and

became
well-known

Under
the
nine-district
plan
adopted
by
the
Iowa
General
Assembly
in
1931
,
the
boundaries
of
the
old
10th
district
were
preserved
as
the
new
8th
district
.
The
last
congressman
elected
by
the
old
10th
district
,
MMSTART_11585581
Fred
C.
Gilchrist
MMEND
,
was
elected
in
the
new
8th
district
in
1932
.
Ten
years
later
,
when
the
1940
census
caused
Iowa
to
lose
another
seat
,
the
new
6th
district
included
all
of
the
old
10th
district
's
counties
,
plus
Wright
County
.
It
was
only

1970
The
third
election
to
the
MMSTART_61268
Greater
London
Council
MMEND
was
held
on
9
April
1970
and
saw
a
Conservative
victory
with
a
reduced
majority
.
In
addition
to
the
100
councillors
,
there
were
sixteen
who
divided
11
Conservative
and
5
Labour
,
so
that
the
Conservatives
actually
had
76
seats
to
40
for
Labour
following
the
election
.
The
poll
in
MMSTART_95390
Hammersmith
MMEND
was
delayed
to
27
April
due
to
the
death
of
one
of
the
Labour
candidates
.
The
original
result
for
MMSTART_94427
Harrow
MMEND
turned
out
to
have
an
enormous
mistake
and
a
recount
was
ordered
on
20
April
which
did
not
alter
the
result
in
terms
of
those
elected
but
did
identify
more
than
25,000
votes
which
had
been
incorrectly
recorded
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
electorate
of
5,524,384
,
there
was
a
turnout
of
35.2
%
.
Labour
recovered
from
its
mauling
three
years
previously
,
but
did
so
primarily
in
working-class
areas
.
Consequently
,
relatively
few
seats
changed
hands
:
Labour
won
back
MMSTART_26598633
Camden

MMSTART_93948
Greenwich
MMEND

MMSTART_95390
Hammersmith

,
MMSTART_95361
Wandsworth
MMEND
,
and
one
seat
in
MMSTART_95362
Lambeth
MMEND
.
The
results
did
enable
Labour
to
take
back
control
of
the
MMSTART_163714
Inner
London
Education

MMEND
and
were
one
of

Until

MMEND

the
Wolf

was
probably
the
closest
equivalent
of

DOCSTART_Panhandle
A
panhandle
is
an
American
informal
MMSTART_1845092
geographic
MMEND
term
for
an
elongated
arm-like
protrusion
of
a

The

derives
from

analogous
part

a
,
and
its
use
is
generally
confined

salient
,
derived
from
.
While
similar
to
a
MMSTART_23260
peninsula
MMEND
in
shape
,
a
panhandle
is
not
surrounded
by
water
on
three
sides
and
connected
to
a
MMSTART_23263
geographical
MMEND
MMSTART_286960
mainland
MMEND
.
Instead
,
it
is
delimited
by
a
land
MMSTART_247613
border

on
at

two
sides
and
extends
out
from

The
panhandle
shape
is
the
result
of
arbitrarily
drawn
international
or
boundaries
,
although
the
location
of
some
administrative
borders
takes
into
account
other
considerations
such
as

economic
ties

or
MMSTART_79239
topography

In

In

Initially
it
was
claimed

death
was
caused
by
hitting
a
wooden
timing
post

Based
on
that
claim
,
Maier
's
fiancÃ©
Hubert

criticized
the
organizers
of
the
race
and
filed
suit
against
them
.
However
,
several
months
later
the
court
found
that
Maier
actually
did
not
hit
the
timing
post
with
her
head
,
but
probably
broke
her
neck
by
crashing
into
a
pile
of
snow
on
the

The
court
did

bequeathed
the
Palatine
share
of
the
Rear
MMSTART_17645322
County
of

MMEND
to
his
son
Karl
.
The

chose
MMSTART_1296944
Birkenfeld
MMEND
as
his
residence
and
in
1595
,
through
the
Treaty
of

with

joint
ruler
the
MMSTART_196475
Margrave
MMEND
of

MMSTART_21195350

MMEND
,
secured
exclusive
rule
in

Under

Following

,
who
ruled
until

He
was
succeeded

who
however

The

passed
to

Christian

a
son
of

younger
brother
,

had
previously
received
the

from
the
holdings
of
MMSTART_58558
ZweibrÃ¼cken

and
thus
founded
the

His
son
MMSTART_12581146
Christian

MMEND
ended
official
residency
at
Birkenfeld
in
1717

resided
primarily
in

who
however
was

married
below

to

so
that

were
not

After

death
his
nephew
became
ruler

Under

rule

the
Rear
County
of
Sponheim
was
finally
partitioned
.
It
was
agreed
that
of
the
two
joint
rulers
,
the
Margrave
of
Baden
was
to
make
the
division
and
then
the
Count
Palatine
by
Rhine
was
to
choose
his
share
.
Possibly
the
hope
on
the
Baden
side
was
that
Karl
III
August
would
decide
on
the
portion
in
which
Birkenfeld
and
the
family
seat
were
located
;
nonetheless
,
Karl

decided
upon
the

that
after

the

region
became
the

As

he

Ahead
of

the

evolved
into
a
main
exponent
of
the
centre-left
secular
camp
and
rival
of
the
Islamist
MMSTART_30876073
Ennahda
Movement
MMEND

In

the
Progressive

have
received
quite
an
amount
of
financial

enabled
the

in
the
MMSTART_33526808
National

Assembly
MMEND

putting
it
at
the
fifth

As
the
party
had
categorically
ruled
out
any
collaboration
with
the
victorious
Islamist
MMSTART_30876073
Ennahda
Movement
MMEND

the
Progressive
Democrats
went
into
opposition

belong
to
the
outspoken
critics
of
the
governing
coalition
of
the
Islamists
with
the
secular
MMSTART_30510758
CPR
MMEND
and

After

the
PDP
launched
talks
with
other
secularist
and
liberal
parties
to
form
a
``
big
party

The
merger
was
realised

They
were

Their
criticism
about

enclosure
MMEND
and
the

material
plight

particularly
notable
to
early

in

a
valuable

abortive

Max

that

enabled
and
sustained
the
rise
of

On
the
other
hand

it
has
been
argued
that
the
Commonwealthmen
``
by
no
means
stand
against
an
individualistic
or

and
--
despite
what

Although
nearly

The

Originally
the

routed
along

rock

built
in

Recognizing
the
inadequacy
of
the
single
lane
road

efforts
began
to
improve
capacity
on
the

road
to

The
first
bore
was
constructed
in

as
part
of
a
reconstruction
of
a
section
of

Concerned

The

flowing
through
the
bore
in
mid-September
of
that
year
.
Construction
on
the
second
bore
began
in
1957
,
when
US

was
widened
to
four
lanes
,
at
a
cost
of
just
over
$
450,000
-LRB-
equivalent
to
$

Coincidentally

both

were
constructed

One
of
the
methods
of
relieving
tension
in
families
is
the
use
of
mediation
.
This
is
vital
due
to
the
sharp
increase
in
divorce
rates
in
Hong
Kong
and
the
lack
of
communication
between
parents
and
children
.
Mediation
is
used
in
a
bid
to
help
salvage
the
family
situation
.
It
teaches
individuals
to
reach
a
settlement
acceptable
to
all
parties
.
The
Society
also
provides
five
types
of
services
and
programs
namely
;
Special
and
Innovative
Services
,
Children

Youth
,
Elderly
and
Community
,
Family

The
Special

The

in

under
the
name
Stade
ForÃ©zien
Universitaire

They
went
through
a
difficult
time
in
the
1960s
,
and
had
to
merge
with
the
CASE
omnisport
structure
in
1975
at
the
request
of
the
municipality
.
It
did
not
help
turn
back
the
tide
,
however
,
and
poor
results
and
fewer
and
fewer
licensed
players
forced
the
club
to
withdraw
its
senior
team
from
all
competitions
in
1991
.
The
next
year
,
the
club
was
restarted
in

the
lowest
French
rugby

and
was

to
climb

gaining
promotion

one

merging

were

he
learned
how

gamble

A
group
of
cheaters
taught
him
how
to
cheat
in
games
,
but
Moss
put
this
knowledge
to
good

As

by

make

safe

he
was
also

``

poker
marathon
set
up
by
MMSTART_979605
Benny
Binion
MMEND
,
winning
between
$
2
and
$
4
million
.
At
the
conclusion
of
the
game
,
Nick
the
Greek
uttered
what
has
become
one
of
the
most
famous
poker
quotes
ever
:
``
Mr.
Moss
,
I
have
to
let
you
go
.
''
This
game
is
often
cited
as
the
inspiration
behind
the
WSOP
.
This
game
became
the
foundation
for
Al
Alvarez
's
book
The
Biggest
Game
in
Town
and
is
one
of
the
best
known
stories
in
poker
.
Despite
being
one
of
the
best
known
poker
stories
,
a
soon
to
be
released
book
,
Showgirl
Stories
,
by
Steve
Fischer
claims
the
game
never
took
place
.
According
to
Fischer
,
there
were
no
stories
or
reports
of
this
tournament
until
six
years
after
Nick
's
death
.
Binion
never
spoke
of
the
game
even
when
providing
a
detailed
history
of
Las
Vegas
and
avoided
answering
questions
about
the
game
by
saying
,
``
Well
,
my
memory
ai
n't
what
it
used
to
be
.
''
While
Nick
the
Greek
was
often
covered
by
the
national
media
,
there
are
no
news
reports
in
any
Vegas
or
national
source
.
Fischer
says
that
nearly
every
version
of
the
story
is
virtually
identical
to
the
version
first
told
by
Moss
beginning
around
1971
.
The
story
is
consistently
said
to
have
taken
place
in
1949
at
the
Horseshoe
Casino
,
a
casino
that
did
not
exist
for
another
year
and
a
half
.
Fischer
also
points
out
that
during
the
time
that
Binion
supposedly
set
up
the
game
,
he
was
fighting
off
a
request
from
Texas
to
have
him
extradited
.
Because
of
his
past
,
Binion
lost
his
license
to
run
a
gambling
establishment
in
1948
and
did
not
regain
it
until
April
13
,
1950
.
He
was
not
granted
a
license
to
open
the
Horseshoe
Casino
until
December
5
,
1952
.
Fischer
believes
that
the
notion
of
Binion
sponsoring
a
poker
game
,
in
front
of
a
window
,
of
a
casino
that
has
n't
opened
,
while
fighting
extradition
is
``
absurd

evidence

existed

Nevertheless
he
is
an
object
of
great
interest
for
,
since
his
magical
trick
is
connected
to
later
cultural
perceptions
of
the
personality
of

Nebka

In

story

Ubaoner
is
described
as

According
to
the
Westcar
Papyrus

Ubaoner
is
betrayed
by
his
own
wife
several
times
.
She
secretly
loves
a
commoner
who
resides
at
MMSTART_96603
Memphis
MMEND
and
sends
him
expensive
clothes
and
other
material
.
The
commoner
comes
to
visit
Ubaoner
's
wife
and
says
to
her
:
``
Is
n't
there
a
MMSTART_1358820
pavilion
MMEND
at
the
lake
?
''
The
wife
says
:
``
See
,
let
's
spend
some
time
in
there
.
''
She
calls
for
Ubaoner
's
MMSTART_10621039
caretaker
MMEND
and
orders
him
:
``
Prepare
the
pavilion
with
all
good
things
.
''
And
so
Ubaoner
's
wife
and
the
commoner
spend
their
time
in
the
pavilion
drinking
together
,
until
they
were
finished
.
Later
that
evening
the
commoner
is
picked
up
by
his
maidservant
,
who
was
waiting
at
the
lake
.
Ubaoner
's
caretaker
was
waiting
there
,
too
and
he
says
:
``
I
will
go
to
Ubaoner
.
''
Two
days
later
the
caretaker
tells
everything
to
Ubaoner
and
makes
the
comment
:
``
See
,
it
was
your
wife
who
spent
a
day
in
your
pavilion
;
she
was
together
with
that
commoner
you
know
.
It
was
MMSTART_58809
adultery
MMEND
what
he
did
,
two
times
,
at
your
lake
.
''
Thereupon
,
Ubaoner
says
to
the
caretaker
:
``
Bring
me
a
pair
of
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
made
of
MMSTART_184073
ebony
MMEND
and
MMSTART_56226
dja'am
MMEND
.
I
will
create
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
and
send
it
as
a
harbinger
.
''
He
creates
a
small
figurine
of
MMSTART_58256
wax
MMEND
in
the
shape
of
a
MMSTART_1284973
crocodile
MMEND
with
a
length
of
seven
fingers
.
He
bewitches
the
figurine
and
gives
it
to
his
caretaker
with
the
words
:
``
When
he
comes
to
purify
himself
in
the
lake
,
this
commoner
,
then
you
may
throw
this
crocodile
made
of
wax
after
him
.
''
The
caretaker
does
as
ordered
and
waits
until
the
next
day
.
The
next
morning
Ubaoner
's
wife
orders
the
caretaker
:
``
Let
the
pavilion
at
the
lake
be
prepared
,
for
I
will
sit
in
it
.
''
Thereupon
she
spends
the
whole
day
in
the
pavilion
together
with
the
commoner
.
Later
that
evening
the
commoner
leaves
the
pavilion
to
take
a
bath
in
the
lake
.
The
caretaker
quickly
throws
the
wax
figurine
after
the
stranger
and
when
the
idol
touches
the
water
it
becomes
a
real
,
living
crocodile
3.70
m
in
length
.
The
animal
devours
the
commoner
and
disappears
in
the
depths
of
the
lake
for
seven
days
.
During
these
seven
days
Ubaoner
is
received
by
pharaoh
Nebka
for
an
important
audience
.
After
the
audience
Ubaoner
invites
Nebka
to
visit
his
house
with
the
words
:
``
May
thy
majesty
proceed
and
see
the
wonder
that
has
happened
in
the
time
of
thy
majesty
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
a
commoner
.
''
.
Nebka
and
Ubaoner
walk
to
the
lake
where
Ubaoner
orders
the
crocodile
to
come
out
of
the
water
and
to
release
the
commoner
.
When
king
Nebka
sees
that
he
says
:
``
This
crocodile
is
dangerous
!
''
But
Ubaoner
bends
down
and
touches
the
crocodile
and
immediately
it
becomes
a
figurine
of
wax
again
.
Then
Ubaoner
gives
a
report
to
Nebka
about
the
affairs
.
Nebka
tells
the
crocodile
:
``
Take
away
what
is
yours
!
''
and
the
animal
grabs
the
commoner
and
then
disappears
.
The
wife
of
Ubaoner
is
brought
to
Nebka
,
too
and
the
pharaoh
sentence
her
to
death
.
She
is
brought
to
a
place
east

the
tricks
performed

The

stacks

He
then
asks
her

place
her

put
one

remarking
that
the
silver
coin
is
slightly
larger

asks

The

also
referred

is
the
classification

MMSTART_1058899
two

As

it
can
describe
a

The
term
describes
the
system

MMSTART_162025
gender

and
attributes
.
Gender
role
is
one
aspect
of
a
gender
binary
.
Many
societies
have
used
the
gender
binary
to
divide
and
organize
people
,
though
the
ways
this
happens
differs
between
societies
.
A
universal
aspect
of
the
gender
binaries
is
that
women
give
birth
.
Gender
binaries
exist
as
a
means
of
bringing
order
,
though
some
,
such
as
MMSTART_1164715
Riki
Wilchins
MMEND
in
GenderQueer
:
Voices
from
Beyond
the
Sexual
Binary
,
argue
that
gender
binaries
divide
and
polarize
society
.
Certain
notable
religions
are
often
used
as
authorities
for
the
justification
and
description
.
MMSTART_6037917
Islam
MMEND
,
for
example
,
teaches
that
mothers
are
the
primary
care
givers
to
their
children
and
MMSTART_606848
Catholics
MMEND
only
allow
males
to
serve
as
their
priests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Exceptions
have
widely
existed
to
the
gender
binary
in
the
form
of
specific
transgender
identities
.
Besides
the
biological
identification
of
intersex
individuals
,
elements
of
the
both
or
neither
sexes
have
been
taken
by
people
biologically
female
and
male
such
as
MMSTART_23929145
Two-Spirit
MMEND
ed
MMSTART_2402376
Native
Americans
MMEND
and
MMSTART_301626
hijra
MMEND
of
MMSTART_14533
India
MMEND
.
In
the
contemporary
MMSTART_21208200
West
MMEND
,
transgender
people
break
the
gender
binary
in
the
form
of
MMSTART_264989
genderqueer
MMEND
.
s
have
a
unique
place
in
relation
to
the
gender
binary
because
in
many
cases
their
gender
expression
transitions
from
one
side
of
the
gender
binary
to
the
other
but
still
conforms
to
the
gender
binary
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
scholars
have
contested
the
existence
of
a
clear
gender
binary
.
There
is
an
increasing
amount
of
research
that
illustrates
that
the
evidence
for
dividing
humans
into
the
two
distinct
categories
of
men
and
women
is
problematic
and
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy
.
For
example
,
MMSTART_36948008
Judith
Lorber
MMEND
explains
the
problem
of
failing
to
question
dividing
people
into
these
two
groups
``
even
though
they
often
find
more
significant
within-group
differences
than
between-group
differences
.
''
Lorber
argues
that
this
corroborates
the
fact
that
the
gender
binary
is
quite
arbitrary
and
leads
to
false
expectations
of
both
genders
.
Instead
,
there
is
growing
support
for
the
possibility
of
utilizing
additional
categories
that
compare
people
without
``
prior
assumptions
about
who
is
like
whom
.
''
By
allowing
for
a
more
fluid
approach
to
gender
,
people
will
be
better
able
to
identify
themselves
however
they
choose
,
and
scholarly
research
will
find
different
similarities
and
differences
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
further
issue
with
the
gender
binary
is
the
insistence
that
men
are
and
women
are
.
This
reduces
options
for
people
to
act
outside
of
their
MMSTART_43094
gender
role

a

system
facilitated
in
part
by
having

man
preside

Genesis
Groups
formed
in
other

would
either
be

The
Hopewell
tradition
was
a
widely
dispersed
set
of
related
populations
,
which
were
connected
by
a
common
network
of
trade
routes
,
known
as

The
Marksville
culture
was
a
southern
manifestation
of
this
network
.
Settlements
were
large
and
usually
located
on
terraces
of
major
streams
.
Evidence
from
excavations
of
burial
mounds
from
this
period
suggest
they
were
constructed
for
persons
of
high
social
status
,
and
contained
grave
goods
of
imported
exotic
materials
such
as
MMSTART_125293

marine

celts

The
pipes
had
flat
bases
with
a
hole
for
a
stem
,
and
a
bowl
in
the
center

Animal
figurines
on
the
platform
are
n't
unusual
,
with
the
bowl
being
located
in

back

The

leaders
organized
community
life

and
officiated
at
burial
ceremonies

an
important
part
of
the
Marksville
Culture

The
mounds
were
constructed
in
stages
over
many
years
,
with
the
first
stage
being
a
flat
,
low
platform
.
The
ceremonies
may
have
been
held
years
apart
and
those

died
between
ceremonies
were
temporarily

during

Circuit

which
Cody
had

It
had
a
deep
fuselage
that
accommodated
the
crew
of
two
side-by-side

The
tail
arrangement
was
unusual
,
with
two

two
rudders
carried
on
four
MMSTART_39029
bamboo

booms
that
led

the
all
moving
tail
surfaces
forming

Fabric
was
stretched
between
the
tail

giving
a
cruciform
shape
as

Lateral
control
was

The

on

The

launched
a

surprised
the

surprise
helped
the
British

Portuguese
to
manage
to
overpower
and
disperse
the
Spanish
horse

foot
inflicting
considerable
loss

As
well
as
250
Spanish
killed
wounded

captured

6
guns

60
artillery
mules
were
acquired

main
target
however

After
some
haggling
a
document
called
``
The

was
drawn
up
.
This
was
in

a
treaty

the

It

not

another

particularly

It

by

MMSTART_18065
Long

and
,
with
some
slight
modifications

by

This

the
Covenanters
sent
another
army
south
to
England
to
fight
on
the
Parliamentarian
side
in
the

Not

in

Ficoll

part

which
is
used
in

laboratories
MMEND
to
separate
MMSTART_3997
blood

Ficoll-Paque
is
normally
placed
at

a

then
slowly
layered
above
Ficoll-Paque

After

the
following

a
layer

cells
called
MMSTART_3832048
buffy
coat
MMEND
-LRB-
/
MNC
-RRB-
,
Ficoll-Paque
,
and
erythrocytes

which
should
be
present
in
pellet
form

This
separation
allows
easy
harvest

Note
that
some
MMSTART_67158

trapping

At
one
time
,
fairly
early
in
the
research
for
diabetes
treatment
by
transplantation
,
Ficoll
was
used
in
an
attempt
to
separate
MMSTART_199453
islets
of
Langerhans
MMEND
from
enzyme
-LRB-
collagenase
-RRB-
digested
human
pancreatic
tissue
.
The
theory
was
that
separated
islets
could
then
be
used
for
transplantation
into
patients
with
.
In
practice
,
using
Ficoll
led
to
difficulty
obtaining
a
pure
enough
preparation
of
islets
,
with
enough
islet
recovery
from
the
original
tissue

for
safe
and
effective
islet
transplantation
in

Because
Ficoll-Paque
layering
is
a
very
slow
process
,
devices
that
aid
in
the
most
time-consuming
step
,
the
overlay
,
have
been
developed
.
One
such
a
product
is
SepMate-50
,
a
specialized
tube
containing
a
porous
insert
that
forms
a
physical
barrier
between
the
Ficoll-Paque
and
blood
sample
.
This
allows
the
blood
sample
to
be
rapidly
pipetted
onto
the
insert
,
avoiding
the
need
for
overlaying
it
directly
onto
Ficoll-Paque
.
The
SepMate
insert
also
reduces
the
duration
of
the
centrifugation
step
,
and
after
centrifugation
,
the
top
layer
containing
plasma
and
PBMCs
can
be
poured
into
a
new
tube
.
Other
devices
include
a
column
containing
a
porous
high-density
MMSTART_77385
polyethylene
MMEND
barrier
or
``
frit
.
''
These
products
allow
blood
to
be
layered
on
much
more
quickly
without
mixing
polysaccharide
and
blood
.
An
example
of
such
a
product
is
the
``
Accuspin
System
Histopaque-1077
''
sold
by
Sigma
Aldrich
.
The
cost
of
this
product
is
significantly
higher
than
basic
Ficoll
and
Ficoll-Paque
products

It
is
also
possible
to
have
the
Ficoll-Paque
separating
system

DOCSTART_Nelsonic_Industries
Nelsonic
Industries
is
the
name
of
an
electronics
manufacturing
and
development
company
that
operated
from
-LRB-
MMSTART_645042
New
York
City
MMEND
-RRB-
in
the
early
1980s
and
throughout
the
1990s
when
it
was
acquired
by
the
watch-manufacturer
,
M.Z.
Berger
.
Nelsonic
produced
numerous
toy-themed
wrist-watches
during
their
existence
,
often
targeting
younger
audiences
with
likenesses
of
characters
from
popular
franchises
such
as
MMSTART_164328
Barbie
MMEND
,
the
MMSTART_205013
Ghostbusters
MMEND
,
MMSTART_81361
Mario
MMEND
,
and
.
Nelsonic
became
notable
during
the
early
mid-1980s
for
being
the
first
electronics
company
in
the
United
States
to
produce
game-watches
-LRB-
multi-purpose
electronic
devices
capable
of
functioning
as
both
a
time-piece
and
as
a
typically
electronic
game
-RRB-
.
For
a
period
subsequent
to
its
purchase
by
M.Z.
Berger
,
Nelsonic
operated
as
a
subsidiary
division
of
its
parent
company
and
game-watches
were
produced
that
bore
the
Nelsonic
mark
.
This
practice
ended
as
M.Z.
Berger
shifted
focus
to
more
traditional
and
higher-end
timepieces
.
Today
the
original
Nelsonic
Game
Watch
line
has
entered
the
secondary
market
and
individual
Game
Watches
have
become
highly
sought-after
collectibles
that
often
fetch
high
prices
on
eBay
and
other
online
auction
websites
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
its
existence
,
Nelsonic
produced
pop-culture-themed
wrist-watches
for
children
and
young
adults
.
The
chronograph
digital
watches
,
typically
made
of
molded
plastic
,
invariably
featured
an
alarm
and
utilized
display-screens
to
display
the
time
for
their
wearers
.
In
time
the
company
began
manufacturing
multi-purpose
units
that
used
the
LCD
screen
to
combine
time
display
functions
with
simple
video
game
functions
.
These
simple
video
games
were
variations
on
the
theme
of
the
MMSTART_2867523
Calculator
watch
MMEND
,
and
the
patent
covering
the
Game
Watch
line
is
in
fact
classified
as
an
``
electronic
calculator
watch
structure
.
''
Becoming
the
first
electronics
manufacturer
in
the
United
States
to
produce
game-watches
,
Nelsonic
earned
a
large
share
in
this
specialized
market
and
was
able
to
earn
the
attention
of
large
video
game
companies
at
events
such
as
the
.
Having
caught
the
popular
attention
and
with
goodwill
at
a
high-point
,
Nelsonic
was
able
to
obtain
licensing
from
several
big-name
video
game
companies
such
as
MMSTART_28222625
Sega
MMEND
,
MMSTART_21197
Nintendo
MMEND
,
MMSTART_430266
Midway
Games
MMEND
,
and
Mylstar
Electronics
.
With
roots
in
the
toy
market
,
Nelsonic
was
also
able
to
obtain
similar
licenses
to
produce
LCD
versions
of
popular
electronic
toys
like
MMSTART_154681
Milton
Bradley
MMEND
's
MMSTART_593761
Simon
MMEND
as
well
as
to
produce
original
LCD
games
for
non-game
toy
franchises
like
MMSTART_164328
Barbie
MMEND
,
MMSTART_28713688
G.I.
Joe
MMEND
,
and
MMSTART_173486
Power
Rangers
MMEND
and
even
for
film
and
TV
franchises
such
as
MMSTART_205013
Ghostbusters
MMEND
.
So
well-known
became
the
Nelsonic
brand
that
it
was
even
able
to
license
its
own
original
games
-LRB-
such
as
the
Nelsonic
version
of
the
public-domain
MMSTART_3981
blackjack
MMEND
which
was
licensed
to
MMSTART_839916
Caesars
Palace
MMEND
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
time
progressed
,
Nelsonic
experimented
with
higher-end
products
such
as
metal
watches
and
increasingly
complex
game-watch
designs
.
In
1990
the
watch-making
giant
,
M.Z.
Berger
,
made
a
large
bid
and
was
able
to
successfully
purchase
the
company
.
For
a
period
of
nearly
a
decade
after
this
acquisition
,
M.Z.
Berger
continued
to
use
Nelsonic
as
a
subsidiary
branch
and
to
employ
the
Nelsonic
mark
in
the
release
of
game-watches
and
the
production
of
new
re-releases
of
popular
models
from
the
1980s
and
early
1990s
.
By
the
end
of
the
1990s
,
however
,
public
interest
had
waned
-LRB-
quite
possibly
due
to
the
rise
in
popularity
of
more
advanced
s
and
,
eventually
,
of
other
portable
computing
devices
,
such
as
s
and
-RRB-
and
this
practice
came
to
an
end
as
M.Z.
Berger
shifted
markets
to
target
higher
end
consumers
more
exclusively
.
*NL*

Today
the
Nelsonic
mark
is
still
in
use

is

It

SDI

realizing

dream

:
the
construction
of
a
MMSTART_29398
Single-stage-to-orbit
MMEND

SSTO
-RRB-
vehicle

In
1984
,
Hunter
proposed
a
vehicle
he
called
the
X-rocket
,
based
on
those
earlier
SSTO
designs

The
design
was
reviewed
by

which
judged
it
worth
pursuing

LMSC
then
declined

he
renamed
the
concept
SSX

and
began
to
refine
it

In
December

the
ad

that
lobbied

Working
together

Hunter

convinced
SDI

that
a

should
be
initiated
to
determine
once

for

the
feasibility
of

This
led
to
a
U.S.
Department

-LRB-
DoD
-RRB-
program
to
design
a
single-stage
vehicle
that
could
replace
military
satellites
on
short
notice

emergency

This
vehicle
was
known

test
fly
a
one-third-scale
,
suborbital
testbed
called
the
MMSTART_585987
DC-X
MMEND
,
or
Delta
Clipper
Experimental
.
While
not
capable
of
spaceflight
,
the
DC-X
incorporated
many
of
the
technologies
needed
for
an
SSTO
vehicle
,
including
highly
automated
systems
enabling
a
quick
turnaround
-LRB-
just
twenty-six
hours
-RRB-
between
launches

It
made
eight
successful
test
flights
between
August
18

1993

July
7

then
was

and
flown
four
times
as
the
DC-XA
between
May

It
was
damaged
on
its
last
flight
when
one
landing
strut
failed
to
deploy
and
the

tipped
over
at

The

-LRB-
meaning

nucleus
MMEND
-
like

is
an
irregularly-shaped
region
within
the
MMSTART_4230
cell
MMEND
of
a
MMSTART_19172225
prokaryote
MMEND
that
contains
all
or
most
of
the
MMSTART_12388
genetic
material
MMEND
.
In
contrast
to
the
MMSTART_6235
nucleus

of
a
MMSTART_24536543
eukaryotic
MMEND
cell
,
it
is
not
surrounded
by
a
MMSTART_12840258

MMEND

The

genome
MMEND
of
prokaryotic
organisms
generally
is
a
circular
,
double-stranded
piece
of
MMSTART_7955
DNA
MMEND
,
of
which
multiple

may
exist
at

A
genophore
is
the
DNA
of
a
prokaryote
.
It
is
commonly
referred
to
as
a
prokaryotic
MMSTART_6438
chromosome
MMEND
.
The
term
``
chromosome
''
is
misleading
for
a
genophore
because
the
genophore
lacks
MMSTART_6933
chromatin
MMEND
.
The
genophore
is
compacted
through
a
mechanism
known
as
,
whereas
a
chromosome
is
additionally
compacted
via
chromatin
.
The
genophore
is
circular
in
most
prokaryotes
,
and
linear
in
very
few
.
The
circular
nature
of
the
genophore
allows
replication
to
occur
without
.
Genophores
are
generally
of
a
much
smaller
size
than
Eukaryotic
chromosomes
.
A
genophore
can
be
as
small
as
580,073
base
pairs

Mycoplasma

Many
eukaryotes

such
as
plants

carry
genophores
in
organelles
such
as

These
organelles
are
very
similar

although

may
differ

it
is

against

Sometimes
even

thought
to
be

are
visible

By
staining
with
the
MMSTART_3248757
Feulgen
stain
MMEND
,
which
specifically
stains
DNA

the
nucleoid
can
also
be

The
DNA-intercalating
stains

and
MMSTART_363891
ethidium

are
widely
used
for
of
nucleoids

*NL*

Experimental
evidence
suggests
that
the
nucleoid
is
largely
composed
of
DNA

about
60
%

with
a
small
amount
of
MMSTART_25758
RNA

and
MMSTART_23634
protein
MMEND

The
latter
two
constituents

She
got
divorced
in

for
a
short
time
and
in

year
moved
to

the

moved
to
a
farm
near
MMSTART_5453118
Dingolfing
MMEND
and
later
to
GroÃwalding
near

they
acquired
a
corn
tower
near
MMSTART_2539663

MMEND
,
which
they
refurbished
into
a
residential
tower
.
In
1920
Karin

In
the

NordstrÃ¶m
published
her
first
novel
``
Tomtelilla
''
both
in
Germany
and
in
Sweden
.
With
her
mother
's
death
an
important
source
of
income
had
run
dry
.
Therefore
,
NordstrÃ¶m
opened
up
,
in
the
tower
,
a
place
for
artists
and
writers
to
live
.
In
these
years
the
couple
started
gradually
to
grow
apart
.
In
1929
the
family
moved
to
Switzerland
.
Shortly
afterwards
Clara
NordstrÃ¶m
moved
with
her
children
to
MMSTART_28565
Stuttgart
MMEND
and
got
a
divorce
in
1935

Throughout
her
life
she
again

therefore
intensely

``

Richard
of

-LRB-
c.

--

-RRB-
,
who
is
not
to
be
confused
with
his
homonym
cousin
MMSTART_25783730
Richard
of
Hauteville
MMEND
,
was
a

in
the
MMSTART_106128

MMEND
and

the
MMSTART_255790

from

Richard
was
born
around
1060
,
the
third
son
of
MMSTART_4333752
William
of
the
Principate
MMEND
,
a
Norman
count
,
and
Mary
,
daughter
of
Guido
,
the
MMSTART_18011
Lombard
MMEND
duke
of

He
was
also
one
of

many
nephews
of
MMSTART_157902
Robert
Guiscard
MMEND
and
MMSTART_157904
Roger
I
of
Sicily
MMEND
and
in
his
early
life
Richard
participated
with
his
two
famous
uncles
to
the
conquest
of
Sicily
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1097
,
Richard
joined
his
cousins
,
MMSTART_157674
Bohemund
of
Taranto
MMEND
and
MMSTART_1127415
Tancred
MMEND
,
on
the
MMSTART_106128
First
Crusade
MMEND
.
Richard
and
Tancred
were
notable
for
being
among
the
few
Crusaders
who
could
speak
MMSTART_803
Arabic
MMEND
,
an
ability
doubtlessly
learned
during
the
wars
in
Sicily
,
which
had
a
strong
Arab
presence
.
MMSTART_157653
Anna
Komnene
MMEND
relates
that
when
Richard
crossed
the
MMSTART_23275478
Adriatic
Sea
MMEND
,
his
ship
was
attacked
and
captured
by
the
MMSTART_2134878
Byzantine
fleet
MMEND
,
who
had
mistaken
him
for
a
pirate
.
He
was
soon
released
and
joined
the
main
Crusader
army
marching
through
MMSTART_3415
Bulgaria
MMEND
and
MMSTART_13275
Hungary
MMEND
.
Along
with
Tancred

Richard
refused
to
swear
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
Byzantine
emperor
MMSTART_1613
Alexius
I
Comnenus
MMEND
,
preferring
to

Richard
was
one
of
the
commanders
at
the
MMSTART_398093
Battle
of
Dorylaeum
MMEND
in
summer
1097
.
1098
,
Richard
and
Tancred
joined
Bohemund
at
the
MMSTART_1119248
siege
of
Antioch
MMEND
.
Richard
was
among
those
captured
with
Bohemund
in
1100
when
ambushed
by
the
MMSTART_1308260
Danishmends
MMEND
at
the
MMSTART_16230308
Battle
of
Melitene
MMEND
.
From
there
Richard
was
sent
to
the
emperor
Alexius
,
who
imprisoned
him
in
MMSTART_5646
Constantinople
MMEND
before
he
was
finally
released
in
1103
.
His
cousin
Tancred
then
appointed
him
governor
of
MMSTART_285454
Edessa
MMEND
in
the
winter
of
1104
,
a
city
which
he
ruled
until
1108
.
He
was
bitterly
hated
by
the
citizens
of
Edessa
for
being
ruthless
and
greedy
.
During
this
time
,
Richard
also
acted
as
a
diplomat
,
traveling
to
France
and
Italy
and
arranging
the
marriage
of
Bohemund
to
the
princess
Constance
of
France
.
He
was
a
witness
of
the
1108
MMSTART_750464
Treaty
of
Devol
MMEND
.
He
also
participated
in
the
ultimately
disastrous
campaigns
Bohemund
waged
against
the
emperor
Alexius
,
but
may
have
been
secretly
plotting
with
Alexius
against
Bohemund

Richard
retired

According
to
legend
,
at
that
time
,
the
Imperial
Palace
was
taken
over
by
an
MMSTART_9897
evil
MMEND
MMSTART_8280
demon
MMEND
,
which
caused
the
MMSTART_10111
Emperor
MMEND
to
fall
ill
with
great
anxiety
and
suffering
.
When
the
Imperial
High
Priests
tried
and
failed
in
their
efforts
to
destroy
the
demon
and
dispel
the
Imperial
household
of
its
influence
,
they
were
at
a
loss
.
Finally
,
an
MMSTART_2007
archer
MMEND
,
MMSTART_189396
Yorimasu
Minamoto
MMEND
,
was
summoned
to
the
Imperial
Palace
in
the
hopes
of
slaying
the
demon
with
his
MMSTART_219810
bow
and
arrow
MMEND
,
riding
the
palace
of
this
plague
.
With
a
steady
hand
and
a
MMSTART_49901
virtuous
MMEND
heart
,
Yorimasu
Minamoto
vanquished
the
demon
with
the
first
arrow
,
and
his
bow
was
declaired
to
be
a
Hama
Yumi
;
an
``
Evil-Destroying
Bow
''
,
-LRB-
and
the
first
arrow
a
Hama
Ya
;
a
``
Evil-Destroying
Arrow
''
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
then
,
Hama
Yumi
have
been
used
in
and
MMSTART_28272
Shinto
MMEND
MMSTART_102920
ritual
MMEND
s
of
purification
.
-LRB-
For
example
--
Shihobarai
--
the
Purification
of
the
Four
Directions
.
In
Japan
,
it
is
universally
believed
that
merely
the
twanging
of
the
MMSTART_10618229
Bowstring
MMEND
will
frighten
ghosts
and
evil
spirits
from
the
house
.
A
MMSTART_590270
Miko
MMEND
will
carry
a
Hama
Yumi
and
a
set
of
Hama
Ya
as
part
of
their
religious
regalia
,
while
back
in
the
,
they
were
used
quite
literally
in
defense
of
the
temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
result
,
Hama
Ya
are
sold
even
today
at
shrines
as
,
-LRB-
good-luck
charms
-RRB-
;
smaller
replicas
have
been
placed
in
shrines
and
people
's
homes
.
It
is
believed
that
even
one
Hamaya
which
has
been
blessed
by
a
Shinto
Priest
carries
great
spiritual
power
,
will
bring
protection
against
the
forces
of
evil
,
and
for
purification
,
and
they
are
also
believed
to
have
the
ability
to
attract
vast
good
fortune
.
Hama
Ya
and
Hama
Yumi
are
often
given
as
gifts
to
celebrate
the
first
New

of
