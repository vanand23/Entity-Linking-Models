I completed both my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science as well as my Master’s degree in Data Science at WPI. I am currently a Data Science Analyst at Verizon, working on impactful projects focused on utilizing large volumes of telecom and customer data to build personalized models and experiences and increase digital sales. I’m passionate about bridging the technical and business aspects of a project, delivering the most seamless experience while maintaining a customer focus.

In my presentation to the Data Science Community and current Graduate Qualifying Project (GQP) students, I will discuss my GQP, called Entity Linking Prediction, as well as my professional journey at Verizon. The data science capstone project experience provided hands-on learning opportunities as well as exposure to professionals in the industry that has been helping me in my first full time role in a corporate environment. I plan to showcase these learnings and key takeaways that I was able to apply at work. I will also share tips and skills for interviews and the workforce that I hope will benefit students when they are looking for or starting new opportunities. Looking forward to seeing you!
